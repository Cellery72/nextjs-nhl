## Next NHL: Next.js + NHL üèí
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application, consuming the NHL API. I built this for fun, and to learn Next.js. 

It's a work in progress, just like everything else on the internet. Feedback is always welcome!

## Getting Started
Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the NHL schedule & team information.
